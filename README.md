## CNN for Text Classification with Keras

This project is about classifying a large number of Wikipedia comments as being either toxic or not (i.e. comments that are rude, disrespectful, or otherwise likely to make someone leave a discussion). This issue is especially important, given the conversations the global community and tech companies are having on content moderation, online harassment, and inclusivity.

The dataset comes from the Toxic Comment Classification Challenge on Kaggle.

In the notebook, I've applied word embeddings for text classification, used 1D convolutions as feature extractors in natural language processing (NLP), and performed binary text classification using deep learning. Please have a look [here](cnn-toxic-comments-classification.ipynb), or open it on [Colab](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1r5rtWK3C2nLw1ZRTrRxNkHTQmW-Z2qWV/view?usp=sharing).
